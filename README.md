## About

A React.js Drone application that uses a Node.js backend to communicate with the DJI Tello Drone via UDP4 sockets, and to communicate to and from the browser Socket.io was implemented. Data sent back from the drone was used to display it's current position in a gyroscope ui, the drone's battery level. Flight data was recorded into a MySql database.

**Clone my repo**

`git clone https://github.com/SaboyaDev/Take-Flight.git`

## Tips

_Make sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) so that you can use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) CLI, which comes with Node.js installation._

Make sure to start both front-end and backend-end servers
